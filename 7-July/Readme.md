Much better code here. 
First of all: it works.
Also, for example, this routine to generate base three number is nicer than the first one

The new method return the next number in base three-rapresentation. I like the fact that it does not use any "math" to derive the result, it's just a "language pattern". All you have to do is pass a string, it will return the next base three number. For example:
"000" --> "001" --> "002" --> "010" --> "011" --> "020" --> ...


The rest of the code written is still total crap. I just wanted to make it works (and it actually does).


The results are the following:
