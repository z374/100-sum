# 100-sum

#### Problem statement:
Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.

### Approach:
I will try to do, every day (or every now and then), an implementation of the problem. The goal is to make, everytime, something different. In particular i want to:
- generalize the problem (different number set, different operations, different dimensions)
- code it in different way (different algorithms)
- code it in efficient way (make it faster)
- code it in cumbersome way (use all the C# language feature, possibly with nonsense criteria)


### List of the implementations done:
1. 06-July-2019: [N611]  Base three approach. There is a string-int drama.
2. 07-July-2019: [Y722]  Base three approach. Ugly way to rapresents solutions and print them.




#### Legend:
 [1-2-3-4] meaning:
 1. Does it work? (Y/N)
 2. My personal satisfaction about the code written (from 0 to 9)
 3. My personal opinion about the quality of the code written (from 0 to 9)
 4. How many hours i've spent to make it (from 0 to 9)
