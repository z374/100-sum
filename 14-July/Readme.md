Well.. The written code is able to generate the desiderd seuqence, but in a ugly way: to do so, it also pass through impossible solution. for example, it also evaluate the sequence.. let's say: 34+5678-9, which do not belongs to the set of "possible solutions". 

I post this algrithm anyway, 'cause otherwise i'm going to stuck and stop this project.  Here is the (ugly) output of the code.
