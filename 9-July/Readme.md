I wanted a different approach for the 100sum problem...
i started with using indexers and proprieties, but get bored, so i did some recursion stuff. Why am I putting this crap here? Cause i dont want to let this "project" die. Start doing nothing is bad. let's keep on walking. 


I've found somewhat hard to do the anagram function (trama).
The hard thing was to realise that it's impossible (or very hard?) to realise a recursive function to generate all the anagarm of a sequence with the signature

public string anagrams(string sequence){ ... }

This wont work cause u have a console.Writeline somewhere that will give u hard time.
I think my solution is pretty ok. Maybe not the best one,... but it works, and i've seen solutions much uglier than mine. 
Nothing more to say.
